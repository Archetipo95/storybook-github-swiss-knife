# Usage

## Quickstart

### Option 1: Reusable Workflow (Recommended)

Call the reusable workflow directly in your repository `.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Storybook

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: write
  pages: write
  id-token: write
  deployments: write

jobs:
  deploy-storybook:
    uses: Archetipo95/storybook-github-swiss-knife/.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml@v0.2.1
    with:
      path: 'storybook-static'
      package_manager: 'npm'
      build_command: 'npm run build-storybook'
```

The caller grants the most any of the workflow's jobs can use: GitHub checks
every job when the run starts, including the directory-mode publisher
(`contents: write`) and the deployment record (`deployments: write`), and
fails the run otherwise. Each job still asks only for what it uses; the build
job runs with `contents: read`.

### Option 2: Composite Action

Use the composite action in your own custom job:

```yaml
name: Custom Deploy Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2

      - name: Build and Deploy Storybook
        uses: Archetipo95/storybook-github-swiss-knife@v0.2.1
        with:
          path: 'storybook-static'
          build_command: 'npm run build-storybook'
```

### Option 3: Trusted Directory Mode Pipeline (Branch-backed)

For branch-backed directory deployments (e.g., publishing to subdirectories on `gh-pages`), use a two-job pipeline separating unprivileged building from trusted publishing with the dedicated `publisher` action:

```yaml
name: Deploy Storybook Directory

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: storybook-pages-${{ github.repository }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
  queue: max

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Storybook
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2

        with:
          node-version: '24'

      - name: Install dependencies and build
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build-storybook

      - name: Upload static build
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@65462800fd760344b1a7b4382951275a0abb4808 # v4.3.3
        with:
          name: storybook-static
          path: storybook-static

  publish:
    name: Publish to Pages Branch
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pages: write
    steps:
      - name: Download build output
        uses: actions/download-artifact@fa0a91b85d4f404e444e00e005971372dc801d16 # v4.1.8
        with:
          name: storybook-static
          path: storybook-static

      - name: Checkout Pages branch
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2

## Support Matrix & Execution Environment

`storybook-github-swiss-knife` is designed and validated for the following support matrix:

| Category             | Supported Environments                                                                   | Notes                                                                                                             |

In the composite action and the reusable workflows, the on/off settings that
the [configuration file](#configuration-file-storybook-pagesyml) can also set
(`preserve_cname`, `generate_badges`, `generate_stats_graph`,
`enable_passcode_gate`, `smoke_test`, `auto_base_url`, `audit_bundle_size` and
`create_deployment`) are declared as string inputs that default to empty. Pass
`true` or `false` as before. When you leave one out, the value comes from the
configuration file, and the default in the table applies only when the file
does not set it either. `create_deployment` defaults to `true` in the reusable
workflows and `false` in the composite action.

When `smoke_test` is enabled, the action serves the static output only on
`127.0.0.1`, opens the manager and canvas with Playwright, and fails on
uncaught page errors, console errors, failed requests, HTTP errors, or a
missing Storybook sidebar. It uses an installed `playwright` package when
available; otherwise it downloads Playwright and Chromium into a temporary
directory for the run. Story globs are matched against `stories.json` or
`index.json` entry ids.

### Install and build commands

`build_command` runs your Storybook build. When `install_command` is empty, the
dependencies are installed first, with the command for `package_manager` and
the project's lockfile:

| `package_manager`                                                  | With a lockfile                           | Without one                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `npm`                                                              | `npm ci`                                  | `npm install`                                |
| `pnpm`                                                             | `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `corepack pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` |
| `yarn`, Yarn 2+ (`.yarnrc.yml` or `packageManager: yarn@2` and up) | `corepack yarn install --immutable`       | `corepack yarn install --no-immutable`       |
| `yarn`, Yarn 1                                                     | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`          | `yarn install`                               |

Without a lockfile the run also warns: commit one for reproducible builds, or
set `install_command`. With no `build_command`, nothing is installed and the
output already at `path` is published. Without a `package.json` at the
repository root (a monorepo whose build command installs in a subfolder, such
as `cd apps/ui && npm ci && npm run build-storybook`), nothing is installed
either, and the run notes it. Bun keeps its own defaults,
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run build-storybook`.

The composite action runs after your job's own steps, so it skips the default
install when `node_modules` already exists; set `install_command` to install
anyway. The reusable workflow enables corepack for pnpm and Yarn, at the version
in `package.json` `packageManager`, so `pnpm` and `yarn` also work in your
commands.

Both commands can span several lines, for example a YAML `|` block. The lines
run in order in one shell:

```yaml
build_command: |
  npm run build:tokens
  npm run build-storybook
```

### Build caching

The reusable workflow enables caching by default in its `contents: read` build job. `actions/setup-node` provides native dependency caching for `npm`, Yarn, and pnpm; Bun uses its package cache. A separate cache restores Storybook builder output from `node_modules/.cache/storybook`, `.cache/storybook`, and `.storybook/.cache`.

Set `cache: false` to disable all reusable-workflow caches, or set `cache_key_prefix` when independent cache namespaces are needed. Cache keys include the runner OS and lockfile or Storybook source/configuration hashes. The untrusted PR preview build deliberately never uses a cache, so forked pull requests cannot share build state with trusted publishing workflows. The deploy-capable composite action also does not manage caches; use the reusable workflow when a read-only cached build is required.

### Outputs

| Output          | Description                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `page_url`      | The URL of the published GitHub Pages site                |
| `status`        | Status of the deployment (`success`, `skipped`, `failed`) |
| `deployment_id` | The GitHub Pages deployment ID                            |

## Configuration File (`.storybook-pages.yml`)

An optional `.storybook-pages.yml` file in the repository root allows centralizing configuration across workflows:

```yaml
version: 1
mode: artifact
path: storybook-static
package_manager: npm
build:
  install_command: npm ci
  build_command: npm run build-storybook
```

_Note: Explicit workflow inputs override file configuration, which in turn overrides default values. An input you leave out (or set to `''`) does not override the file._

For Bun projects, use the reusable workflow and set `package_manager: bun`. It provisions Bun in its read-only build job; the deploy-capable composite action intentionally rejects Bun so installation never runs in a job with Pages, OIDC, or write privileges. When omitted, the commands default to `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run build-storybook`:

```yaml
package_manager: bun
build:
  install_command: bun install --frozen-lockfile
  build_command: bun run build-storybook
```

### Trusted directory mode

Set `mode: directory` to publish to a shared Pages branch. The build job remains untrusted (`contents: read`) and transfers its validated output to a separate publisher job with `contents: write`. Writes are serialized by the `storybook-pages-<owner>/<repo>` concurrency group with `queue: max`: up to 100 runs wait instead of replacing each other and run first in, first out by when each run started waiting (not by when it was triggered; GitHub notes that ordering is not guaranteed; see [PR previews → Concurrency](pr-previews.md#concurrency)). A rejected push is retried on the fresh branch tip, and the configured target is staged and replaced atomically. GitHub Pages normally rebuilds automatically after a branch push; set `trigger_pages_rebuild: 'true'` only when an explicit rebuild request is needed for a non-standard Pages configuration.

Use an empty `target_directory` for the production root and a name such as `staging` for a named environment; both can coexist. Targets must be relative and cannot traverse or address `.git` or `.github`. Unrelated directories are preserved. GitHub Pages has one site/custom-domain configuration, so named environments are URL subpaths (for example `/staging`) and publication is eventually visible after the rebuild.

### Custom domains (`CNAME`)

How GitHub Pages picks up a custom domain depends on the publishing source:

- **Artifact mode** (`actions/deploy-pages`): GitHub ignores `CNAME` files in the deployed artifact. Configure the domain in repository **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**. Setting `cname` in artifact mode only emits a warning.
- **Directory mode** (branch-backed): GitHub reads the domain from the `CNAME` file at the root of the Pages branch, so that file must survive every publish.

In directory mode, an existing root `CNAME` is kept when a root publish replaces the branch contents and neither `cname` nor the build output provides one, so the custom domain is not reset and certificate renewal keeps working. Subdirectory publishes (named environments, PR previews) never touch the root `CNAME`. Set `preserve_cname: false` to let a root publish remove it.

Set `cname: storybook.example.com` to have the publisher write the file for you. The value must be a bare hostname: schemes (`https://`), ports, paths, and trailing slashes are rejected. Precedence on a root publish is: `cname` input, then a `CNAME` shipped in the build output (for example from `.storybook/public`), then the preserved branch file.
